    <h1>Scholar's School & College</h1>
    <section><h2>About Us:</h2>
    Welcome to Scholars Where <b>YOU DON'T MATTER!</b>
    oh you are not a topper? Then you dont matter at all. Only the high prestegious students matter in our school. If you are not prestegious then good luck staying here! Because if you can't withstand teachers making your ears bleed by airstriking you with more than a million slangs and cuss words then you simply and clearly dont belong here.

    <h2>Extra Curricular Activities:</h2>
    <p>We host many extra curriculur activities every year!
        every year our annual sports are held where students can participate in a number of events like 100m run,
        cock fight, etc. For the children we have math run, normal race, dress as you like, etc.
        Even the teachers at our school participate in these events. But our main event is at the opening for the <mark><b>Scouts</b></mark>. Of course not anyone can join this and only the prestegious students who have the endurance to go though grueling exericse sessions without studying only can join.
    </p>
    <p>And for some other activities that happen are the <mark><b>Science fair, Debate etc.</b></mark></p>
