    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
    <p>My coding journey started with codingal and my friends. My code instructor has said that coding may seem difficult at first but its really just logic. And its true! Coding really is 80% application of your logic. We first started the basics of this awesome journey through the block based coding of 'Scratch' and 'MIT App Inventor'. After a long 6 motnths we finally get to fully utilize out fingers and keyboard and are on to VS Code for text based typing. I hope what comes after will truly be exhilarating.</p>
